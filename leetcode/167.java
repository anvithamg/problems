/*167. Two Sum II - Input array is sorted
Easy

Given an array of integers numbers that is already sorted in non-decreasing order, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number.

Return the indices of the two numbers (1-indexed) as an integer array answer of size 2, where 1 <= answer[0] < answer[1] <= numbers.length.

The tests are generated such that there is exactly one solution. You may not use the same element twice.

 

Example 1:

Input: numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [1,2]
Explanation: The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 2.

Example 2:

Input: numbers = [2,3,4], target = 6
Output: [1,3]

Example 3:

Input: numbers = [-1,0], target = -1
Output: [1,2]*/
class Solution {
    public int[] twoSum(int[] numbers, int target) {
        int[] ans = new int[2];
        for (int i = 0; i < numbers.length - 1; i++) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < numbers.length; j++) {
                if (numbers[i] + numbers[j] == target) {
                    ans[0] = i + 1;
                    ans[1] = j + 1;
                }
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
